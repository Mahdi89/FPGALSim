# FPGALSim

A novel FPGA-accelerated GALS NoC simulator. This simulator is able to model a multi-core system 
including on-chip networks with associated interactions using virtual asynchronous routers on a single FPGA. It 
achieves its capability in modelling accurate and fast GALS NoC systems by taking the VIRTUAL ROUTING 
technique into account.
